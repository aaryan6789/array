 * Dominant Index
 * In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.
 *
 * Find whether the largest element in the array is at
 * least twice as much as every other number in the array.
 *
 * If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
Output: 1

Explanation: 6 is the largest integer,
and for every other number in the array x,
6 is more than twice as big as x.

The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1

Explanation:
4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.
Note:
nums will have a length in the range [1, 50].
Every nums[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 99].
